# South African Victim Data Standard (SA‑VDS)

## Project Charter

### Purpose
This repository hosts the development of a **standardized data collection framework** for human trafficking victims in South Africa. The framework aims to ensure consistent, comparable, and high‑quality data across all stakeholders—law enforcement, social services, healthcare providers, NGOs, migration officials, and policy makers.

Standardized data is crucial for:
- **Accurate analysis** of trafficking patterns and trends.
- **Effective resource allocation** to areas of greatest need.
- **Evidence‑based policy‑making** that addresses the root causes of trafficking.
- **Improved victim support** through coordinated, multi‑agency responses.
- **Strengthened prosecutions** by providing reliable, court‑ready information.

### Background
Human trafficking is a complex crime that intersects with human rights, labour, migration, public health, socio‑economic development, and morality. South Africa has made progress in policy and legislation, but fragmented data collection hampers the national response. This project, led by the Inter‑Agency Task Team on Human Trafficking, seeks to close that gap by creating a unified, open, and version‑controlled data standard.

### Repository Structure
- `data-template-v1.md` – The core data collection template (current version).
- `.github/` – Issue templates, workflows, and collaboration guidelines (to be added).
- `docs/` – Supplementary documentation (to be added).

### How to Contribute
We welcome input from all stakeholders. There are several ways to participate:

1. **Review the current template**  
   Read the latest version of the template ([`data-template-v1.md`](data-template-v1.md)) and suggest improvements.

2. **Provide feedback via GitHub Issues**  
   We have opened three dedicated issues for different stakeholder groups:
   - **[Issue #1: Law Enforcement & Prosecutorial Needs](https://github.com/z-teckson/sa-victim-data-standard/issues/1)** – What data is critical for investigations and building legal cases?
   - **[Issue #2: Healthcare & Social Service Provider Needs](https://github.com/z-teckson/sa-victim-data-standard/issues/2)** – What information is needed for effective long‑term care and support?
   - **[Issue #3: Migration & Border Control Needs](https://github.com/z-teckson/sa-victim-data-standard/issues/3)** – What data is essential for understanding cross‑border trafficking trends?

   Please comment directly on the relevant issue. If you are not on GitHub, you can email your feedback to the Task Team secretariat.

3. **Propose changes via Pull Requests**  
   If you are familiar with Git, you can fork this repository, create a branch, edit the template, and open a pull request. All changes will be reviewed by the Task Team before merging.

4. **Spread the word**  
   Share this repository with colleagues and networks that should be part of the conversation.
